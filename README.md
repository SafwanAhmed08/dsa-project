- **Display Account:** View details of any account by providing its account number.
- **Process Transactions:** Deposit or withdraw money, with all transactions recorded in a queue.
- **Transaction History:** View all transactions performed on an account.
- **Hash Table Storage:** Accounts are stored in a hash table for efficient access.
